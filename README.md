Rails - Gallery

## Summary

A basic app for uploading and viewing picture files. 

## Rationale

The Procreate gallery is gone!

## User Story

When I open the site, I am greeted with an array of random photos
that me / other users have uploaded. 

When I log in, I see my personal gallery. I then have the option to do the following. 
    <br>&emsp; Choose to upload and delete photos in my gallery. 
    <br>&emsp; Select a photo and zoom in/out
    <br>&emsp; Select a photo and download/share 
    <br>&emsp; Tick the option for each file to be randomly viewable 
    in the array of random photos in the site.
    <br>&emsp; Optional: responsive design.
